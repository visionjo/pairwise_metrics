# Pairwise Metrics and Visualization
## Overview
Evaluation and visualization tools for pairwise measures. The motivation for this repo is to evaluate clustering 
algorithms. However, amongst other use cases, this code-base is relevant in problems that involve sample pairs and 
distance matrices.

## Motivation
SKLearn is complete with many metrics, which include submodules for 
[clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics.cluster) and
[pairwise](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#pairwise-metrics). However, this code-base sets out to 
compliment this with pairwise metrics determined for cluster (or class) assignments of arbitrary assignments.
